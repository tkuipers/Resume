\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Software Developer with hands-on experience in the industry. I attended school in Edmonton, graduated in early 2017, and
have since been working in the field. My enthusiastic and supportive nature is integral to maintaining a collaborative solution-
driven environment. Previous performance in lead developer roles has allowed me to directly influence the successful release of
projects. I have a proven record of successfully completing assigned tasks from remote locations.
