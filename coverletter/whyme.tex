\lettersection{Why Me?}
During my career as a software developer, I’ve developed skills in Gosu and Java, object-oriented design patterns, and a knowledge of Agile design methods and principles. This knowledge has enabled me to become proficient at writing easy to read, well modularized, efficient code.

Beyond that, I am familiar with setting goals and achieving them. I have a proven track record of being able to conceive, plan, develop, and execute strategies resulting in well-written programs. I strongly feel that my software development skills, coupled with my ability to work hard and be positive, will be of immediate value to ReelData.AI.
