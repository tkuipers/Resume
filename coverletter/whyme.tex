\lettersection{Why Me?}
Over the course of my career, I’ve broadened my skills in object-oriented design patterns, test-driven development, and collaboration with colleagues. 
This knowledge has enhanced my proficiency in writing easy to read, well-modularized, efficient code.
Beyond that, I am familiar with setting professional goals and achieving them. 
I have a proven track record of being able to conceive, plan, develop, and execute strategies resulting in well-written software. 
While I do not have professional experience working in cryptography, I am a fast learner and am incredibly motivated.
Although I live in Canada, I know that my development skills, coupled with my ability to work hard and be positive, will be of immediate value to Signal.
