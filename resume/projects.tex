            This project pulls news articles and stock information about specific tickers from the internet nightly.  
            It runs the article through IBM's tone analyzer and uses the result to train a small neural network.  
            The network attempts to correlate the tone of a particular article to a stock's outcome over the next day.  
            A user is then able to enter a stock ticker, and the program will pull the most recent article it can find 
            for that company, and attempt to predict whether the stock will go up or down the next day.

            It is implemented in python, using GitHub actions to train and deploy the program to EC2 and Lambdas on AWS weekly.
